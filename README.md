üè• HealthLink ‚Äì Full-Stack Healthcare Application (In-Progress)

HealthLink is an in-progress full-stack healthcare platform built to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers through a digital-first experience. The aim is to create a reliable system where patients can book appointments, manage medical records, and access healthcare services conveniently, while doctors and admins can handle scheduling and patient data efficiently.

This project demonstrates my skills in React, CSS, Node.js, Express, and MySQL by combining a clean user interface with a robust backend and a relational database for secure and scalable performance.
